# Student Books

Welcome to the Student Books app, a dedicated platform for students to buy and sell textbooks with ease. This repository contains both the client-side application, created with Expo React Native, and the server-side application, built with Node.js.

## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed on your machine:

- Node.js (https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- npm (comes installed with Node.js)
- Expo CLI (`npm install -g expo-cli`)

## Installation

To get the application running, follow these steps:

### Backend

1. Navigate to the project's root directory in your terminal.
2. Change directory to the `server` folder with `cd server`.
3. Install the required npm packages with `npm install`.
4. Start the Node.js server with `npm start`.

### Frontend

1. Open a new terminal window or tab.
2. Navigate back to the project's root directory if you're not already there.
3. Change directory to the `client` folder with `cd client`.
4. Install the required npm packages with `npm install`.
5. Start the Expo server with `npm start`.

## Usage

Once both the Node.js server and Expo server are running, you can:

- Open the Student Books app on your iOS or Android device using the Expo Go app.
- Use a simulator/emulator to run the app on your machine.
